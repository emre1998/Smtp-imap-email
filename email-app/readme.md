What is the difference between IMAP and SMTP?

-IMAP is for the retrieval of emails and SMTP is for the sending of emails. That means IMAP talks to both the client and server to get emails, and SMTP talks only to servers to send emails.

What is SMTP?

-SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and it’s the industry standard protocol for email sending.

With SMTP you are sending, relaying, or forwarding messages from a mail client (like Microsoft Outlook) to a receiving email server. A sender will use an SMTP server to carry out the process of transmitting an email message.

The key thing to keep in mind when thinking about whether to use SMTP or IMAP, is that SMTP is about sending email. So, if you’re looking to enable email sending within your application, then you’ll want to go ahead with using SMTP over IMAP.

What is IMAP?

-If SMTP is all about sending, then: What is IMAP?

Simply put, IMAP (Internet Access Message Protocol) is an email protocol that deals with managing and retrieving email messages from the receiving server.

Since IMAP deals with message retrieval, you will not be able to use the IMAP protocol to send email. Instead, IMAP will be used for receiving messages.
